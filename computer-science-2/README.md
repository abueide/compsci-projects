# Computer Science 2

Core Computer Science class, main language is java.

## Homework

The first homework assignment was solo, but from homework two onward I will be working with a partner. A design document is due 1 week and the actual homework assignment due the next. So each homework assignment takes place over the course of 2 weeks.

## Labs

With labs we do pair coding. I usually write the code one week and my partner writes code the next week. We review each other's code and explain anything that is confusing. In this repo, I'll only post the labs that I wrote.

For both the homeworks and the labs you can view the problem descriptions in the handouts folder. (e.g. hw01/handouts or lab1/handouts)
